The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface or method for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is used when the exact type of object to be created is determined at runtime.

Use Case of Factory Design Pattern

Key Scenarios:
- **Encapsulation of Object Creation Logic:**
  - When the creation process involves complex logic, a factory simplifies the process for the client.
- **Reducing Coupling:**
  - Clients interact with interfaces or abstract classes, not with the concrete classes directly, reducing dependency on specific implementations.
- **Runtime Object Creation:**
  - When the type of object to create is determined dynamically at runtime based on user input, configuration, or other factors.
- **Extensibility:**
  - New types of objects can be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

Benefits:
- Promotes code reuse and maintainability.
- Centralizes object creation, making it easier to manage changes or extensions.
- Enhances flexibility in choosing object types without altering client code.

Example Use Cases:
- Database connections for different database systems (e.g., MySQL, SQLite).
- Notification services to send emails, SMS, or push notifications.
- Logging systems to log to a console, file, or external service.
