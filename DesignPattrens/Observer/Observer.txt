3. Observer Pattern
Purpose:
- Establish a one-to-many relationship between objects, where one object (subject) notifies multiple dependent objects (observers) of any state changes.

How it works:
- Observers register themselves with the subject.
- When the subject's state changes, it notifies all registered observers.

Real-Life Examples:
- Weather Monitoring System: Sensors (subject) send updates to multiple displays (observers) when weather conditions change.
- Stock Market: A stock (subject) notifies all investors (observers) whenever its price changes.
